## what is this
this is a really easy to use to-do list, built entirely on command-line usage! this means you can add, edit, delete todos right from your CLI, and view a list of them in the TUI! It's a really easy and fun way to organize your life.
<br>you can even add parameters to your todos like priorities, due dates, or files to easily know where to get working!
<br><br>=> check out the MP4 at the top to get a overview of the project; I do understand installing this can be annoying. So the MP4 should give you the basics!!!
