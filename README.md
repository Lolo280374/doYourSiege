**simple todo-list to organize your life the best way possible without ever leaving a command line!**
<br>**saves all your data in an easy json file, so you can easily share it, edit, or save it somewhere else!**
<br>**made for the Siege event at HackClub, 2025 :)**

> check out the calendar text user interface, pls!!! (todo calview) thx :)

## what is this
this is a really easy to use to-do list, built entirely on command-line usage! this means you can add, edit, delete todos right from your CLI, and view a list of them in the TUI! It's a really easy and fun way to organize your life.
<br>you can even add parameters to your todos like priorities, due dates, or files to easily know where to get working!
<br><br>=> check out the MP4 at the top to get a overview of the project; I do understand installing this can be annoying. So the MP4 should give you the basics!!!
